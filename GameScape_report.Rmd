As the industry continues to evolve, e-games are expected to become an even more integral part of global culture, with expanding opportunities in both recreational and professional sectors.

### 1.2 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive Shiny app that provides a comprehensive analysis of the top 250 highest-rated games on Steam. Users can explore and filter games based on rank, score, release date, and price to discover games that suit their preferences. With detailed game stats, customisable filters, and engaging visual insights, the app offers a personalized experience for exploring, comparing, and saving favorite games

#### 1.2.1 Statistics Analysis:

-   Collect and process comprehensive statistics from Steam’s top 250 games, including data on game price, user ratings, critic reviews, and release dates.
-   Use data visualization techniques to present these insights, allowing users to easily grasp trends and key metrics..

#### 1.2.2 Filtering Mechanisms:

-   Develop filters enabling users to explore and sort games by criteria such as rank, price, release year, rating scores, and personal favorites.
-   Provide a user-friendly search interface to refine results according to individual preferences.

#### 1.2.3 Providing Choices:

-   Implement visual comparisons of game scores and ratings using bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
-   Offer users an interactive, visual approach to comparing games, aiding in decision-making and enhancing the browsing experience.

## 2.1 Scraping and Cleaning the Data

The data for different purposes has been scraped from various sources.

We have scraped the following data:

1.  Rank According To Score of top 250 games according to stream 250

2.  Release Dates of top 250 games according to stream 250

3.  Scores of top 250 games according to stream 250

4.  Audience Rating of top 250 games according to stream 250

5.  Total Votes of top 250 games according to stream 250

6.  Game Price of top 250 games according to stream 250

The raw datasets that we obtained from the respective webpages were not ready-to-use. There were many missing values and there also were some discrepancies in the data. We had to clean the data and also organize the data in a way that is easy to use.

We used the following libraries for doing these tasks:

1.  rvest
2.  tidyverse
3.  dplyr
4.  httr

For example, here is a snippet of code that was used to extract data for for ranking according to scores:

```{r message=FALSE, fig.show='hold'}

library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

game_dataset <- read.csv("game_dataset.csv")
```

## 2.2 Description of our Data

1.  Game Title = Indicating the name of the game
2.  Rank = Rank based on score of the games
3.  Release Dates = Date when the game was released in the market
4.  Scores = Score which is a function of audience reviews and number of reviews
5.  Audience Rating = Average of the ratings which was given by the audience
6.  Total Votes = Based on the number of players and streamers who played and reviewed the game
7.  Game Price = Price of the game during its launch.

## 3. Visualising the Dataset

### 3.1 Libraries we used in this process

-   shiny
-   DT
-   dplyr
-   ggplot2
-   bslib

### 3.2 Shiny app

The Shiny app developed by our group offers a streamlined and interactive platform for exploring Steam’s top 250 highest-rated games. The app is divided into key tabs for an intuitive user experience:

#### 3.2.1. Overview Tab:

-   Provides a summary of the dataset, displaying key statistics like total games, average scores, and average votes.
-   Includes a boxplot of game scores, offering users a quick visual overview of the distribution of ratings across all games.

#### 3.2.2. Search and filter tab:

-   Allows users to filter games by various criteria, including release date, score, price, ratings, and title keywords, enabling a targeted search experience.
-   Features an interactive scatter plot that compares the price and number of votes for the filtered games, helping users visually assess how popularity and price correlate.

#### 3.2.3.Top Games Tab:

-   Displays a list of top games based on user-selected criteria like score and price, allowing users to see which games rank highest according to their preferences
-   Offers a bar plot view to compare the top games on either score or price, making it easier to identify standout games in each category.

### 3.3 Generating visualisations for "E Games " using our Shiny App

#### 3.3.1 Box plot of ratings of all games

```{R}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Convert Score column to numeric if it's not already
game_dataset$Score <- as.numeric(game_dataset$Score)

# Create a box plot of game ratings (scores)
ggplot(game_dataset, aes(y = Score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Game Ratings", y = "Ratings", x = "") +
  theme_minimal()



```

-   **Observation:** The box plot represented that maximum percentage of the games have ratings between 8.5 to 8.6 with few outliers having rating 8.8 .

-   **Implication:** This shows that gamers usually don't usually have very extreme opinions about most of the games except few games which really stands out.

-   **Purpose:**.The filtering mechanism helps a new user to filter the games based on his/her preferance and explore all the alternatives and make an informed decision before purchasing a game.

-   **Observation:** In this Point and Segment Plot, as we move from left to right, batsmen's best scores decrease. Different team colors reveal diverse team performances, showcasing individual player contributions.

#### 3.3.4 A Scatter Plot for no. of votes vs. price

```{R}
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Convert 'Number of Votes' and 'Price' to numeric if they are not already
game_dataset$Number.of.Votes <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", game_dataset$Number.of.Votes)) # Remove commas if present
game_dataset$Price <- as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", game_dataset$Price)) # Remove dollar signs if present

# Create a scatter plot of Number of Votes vs. Price
ggplot(game_dataset, aes(x = Price, y = Number.of.Votes)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Number of Votes vs. Price", x = "Price ($)", y = "Number of Votes") +
  theme_minimal()


```

-   **Observation:** In the Scatter Plot for number of votes and price of games we can see concentrations of scores in the price range of \$15 to \$25

-   **Implication:** The concentration of high number of votes ar a particular point indicates the purchasing power of the players which implies how much players on the average are ready to pay for games. Also the low number of votes at high price games show that players on the average cannot afford to play very niche games whose price exceeds or equals to \$60

#### 3.3.5 A Bar chart top 10 game titles by price

```{R}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Filter out games with 'Free' in the Price column, clean the Price column, and convert to numeric
game_dataset <- game_dataset %>%
  filter(Price != "Free") %>%
  mutate(Price = as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", Price)))

# Select the top 10 games by price
top_10_expensive_games <- game_dataset %>%
  arrange(desc(Price)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10)

# Plot the bar chart
ggplot(top_10_expensive_games, aes(x = reorder(Titles, Price), y = Price)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Game Titles by Price", x = "Game Titles", y = "Price ($)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

-   **Observation:** The chart shows that the top 10 most expensive games are priced around \$50-\$60, featuring popular and high-quality titles.
-   **Implication:** Players are willing to pay a premium for well-known, high-value games, suggesting a viable market for premium-priced titles in established franchises.

## 4. Conclusion

-   **Summary:** These observations collectively reveal several key relationships within the dataset, emphasizing the interconnected nature of price,score and audience reviews

-   **Recommendation:** Consider leveraging these insights for buying a new game.

By presenting your observations in a structured and clear manner, you convey the significance of the relationships observed in your project data. This approach helps readers understand the implications and potential trends that can be derived from the analyzed patterns.
